'''
1. Manual Sum Function: 
Create a function called manual_sum that iterates over list and adds their sum in a variable, 
then returns variable. Use for loop for this task.
'''
# def manual_sum(arr):
#     sum = 0
#     for i in arr:
#         sum += i
#     return sum

'''
2. Manual Max Function: Define a function named manual_max that iterates through list, 
updating a variable with the maximum value, 
then returns the maximum value found. 
Use for loop for this task.
'''
# def manual_max(arr):
#     max = arr[0]
#     for i in arr:
#         if i > max:
#             max = i
#     return max

'''
3. Manual Min Function: Define a function named manual_min that iterates through list, 
updating a variable with the minimum value, 
then returns the minimum value found. 
Use for loop for this task.
'''
# def manual_min(arr):
#     min = arr[0]
#     for i in arr:
#         if i < min:
#             min = i
#     return min


'''
4. Manual Len Function: 
Develop a function named manual_len that iterates through list, 
counting each element, 
and returns the count as the length of the list. 
Use for loop for this task.
'''

# def manual_len(arr):
#     count = 0
#     for i in arr:
#         count += 1
#     return count


'''
5. Copy function of reduce: 
define a function named manual_reduce that takes a list as input, 
then create an empty list named copied_list to store the copied items inside it. 
use for loop to loop over each item in the original list, 
append them to the copied_iterable list.
In the end, return the copied_iterable after iterating through all items.
finally demonstrate the usage of the manual_reduce function by creating an original list, 
making a copy of it, and printing both the original and copied lists.
'''

# def manual_reduce(arr):
#     copied_list = []
#     for i in arr:
#         copied_list.append(i)
#     return copied_list
