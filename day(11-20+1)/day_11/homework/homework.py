'''
1) Write a program that takes an input from the user and checks if it's a positive, 
negative, 
or zero number using if-else.
'''

# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print("even")
# elif num % 2 != 0:
#     print("odd")
# else:
#     print("zero")

'''
2)Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop and if statement.
'''

# for i in range(1,20+1):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)

'''
3)Write a program that calculates the sum of a number entered by the user using a while loop.
'''
# sum = 0
# num = int(input("Enter a number (input 0 to calculate the sum): "))
# while num != 0:
#     num = int(input("Enter a number (input 0 to calculate the sum): "))
#     sum += num
# print(sum)

'''
4)Write a program that simulates a basic ATM. It should ask the user for their PIN, 
and if it's correct, display a text withdrawal, deposit, and balance. 
'''

# pin = int(input("Enter your pin: "))

# while pin != 1234:
#     pin = int(input("Enter your pin: "))


# print("withdrawal")
# print("deposit")
# print("balance")


'''
5)Write a program that simulates a simple login system. Ask the user for a username and password, 
and if they enter "admin" and "password123", respectively, print "Login successful" using if-else.
'''

# username = input("Enter your username: ")
# password = int("enter your password: ")

# while username != "admin" and password != "password123":
#     username = input("Enter your username: ")
#     password = int("enter your password: ")

# print("Login successful")


'''
6) Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints a message based on the age range 
(e.g., "Child", "Teenager", "Adult") using if-elif-else.
'''

# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# if age <= 12:
#     print("Child")

# elif 13 < age <= 19:
#     print("Teenager")

# else:
#     print("Adult")
